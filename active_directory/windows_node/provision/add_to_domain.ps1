# NB this will basically force dns requests to fail with icmp destination port
#    unreachable (instead of timing out and delaying everything), which in turn
#    will force windows to query other dns servers (our domain dns server that
#    is set on the domain adapter).
# NB we cannot set this to the domain controller dns server because windows will
#    always use this interface to connect the dns server, but since its only
#    reachable through the domain adapter, the dns responses will never arrive
#    and dns client will eventually timeout and give up, and that breaks WDS
#    because dns takes too long to reply.
